## Installation

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher.
2.  **pip:** Python package installer (usually comes with Python).
3.  **Tesseract OCR Engine:**
    *   **macOS:** `brew install tesseract tesseract-lang`
    *   **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr libtesseract-dev tesseract-ocr-all` (Install desired language packs, e.g., `tesseract-ocr-fra`)
    *   **Windows:** Download installer from [UB Mannheim Tesseract Wiki](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki). **Ensure Tesseract is added to your system's PATH.**
4.  **Poppler PDF Rendering Library:**
    *   **macOS:** `brew install poppler`
    *   **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install poppler-utils`
    *   **Windows:** Download latest binaries from [Poppler for Windows Releases](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/). Extract and add the `bin/` directory to your system's PATH.

### Using the Installer Script (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Python dependencies and check system prerequisites is using the provided script:

```bash
# Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/pdf-ocr.git
cd pdf-ocr

# Run the installer script
python install_dependencies.py

# To install optional OCR engines (EasyOCR, PyOCR):
# python install_dependencies.py --engine easyocr
# python install_dependencies.py --engine pyocr
# python install_dependencies.py --engine all
```

The script will:
*   Check your Python version.
*   Install core Python packages (`Flask`, `pytesseract`, `python-docx`, `pdf2image`, `Pillow`, etc.).
*   Check if Tesseract and Poppler are accessible via the system PATH.
*   Optionally install dependencies for EasyOCR and PyOCR.

### Manual Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/pdf-ocr.git
    cd pdf-ocr
    ```

2.  **Install core Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **(Optional) Install dependencies for other OCR engines:**
    ```bash
    # For EasyOCR (may require manual PyTorch installation first - see https://pytorch.org/)
    pip install -r requirements-easyocr.txt

    # For PyOCR
    pip install -r requirements-pyocr.txt
    ```

4.  **Verify System Dependencies:** Ensure Tesseract and Poppler are installed and accessible in your system's PATH.

### Docker Installation

For a containerized setup (no need to install Tesseract or Poppler locally):

1. **Build and run with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Or build and run manually:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t ocr-pdf-docx .
   docker run -p 8011:8011 ocr-pdf-docx
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8011`.

## Usage

1.  **Start the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8011` (or the configured host/port).

2.  **Open the web interface:** Navigate to the URL in your web browser.

3.  **Upload PDF:** Drag and drop a PDF file onto the designated area or click to browse.

4.  **Configure Options (Optional):**
    *   Click the "Show" button next to "Options" to expand the settings panel.
    *   **Preprocessing:** Enable and configure image enhancement options or select a preset profile. Adjust DPI if needed.
    *   **Processing:** Select the desired OCR Engine (Tesseract, EasyOCR, PyOCR), Document Language (for Tesseract), and OCR Quality.
    *   **Output:** Choose the desired Output Format (DOCX, TXT, MD, HTML).

5.  **Convert:** Click the "Upload and Convert" button.

6.  **Monitor Progress:** You will be redirected to a status page showing the conversion progress with real-time updates.

7.  **Download:** Once complete, click the "Download" button on the success page.

8.  **Convert Another:** Click "Convert Another File" to return to the upload page.

## Configuration

The application can be configured using environment variables (e.g., in a `.env` file):

*   `FLASK_ENV`: Set to `development` for debug mode, `production` otherwise.
*   `SECRET_KEY`: A strong, random secret key for session management. If not set, a temporary one is generated.
*   `PORT`: The port the application runs on (default: `8011`).
*   `HOST`: The host to bind to (default: `0.0.0.0` in Docker, `127.0.0.1` otherwise).
*   `UPLOAD_FOLDER`: Directory for uploaded files (default: `uploads/`).
*   `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`: Maximum upload size in bytes (default: 64MB).
*   `CLEANUP_INTERVAL`: How often to run cleanup of old files in seconds (default: 3600).
*   `CLEANUP_THRESHOLD`: Age in seconds after which temporary files are deleted (default: 86400 - 1 day).
*   `DOCKER_ENV`: Set to `true` when running in Docker (automatically set in the Dockerfile).

Example `.env` file:
```
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
PORT=8011
HOST=0.0.0.0
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH=67108864
CLEANUP_INTERVAL=3600
CLEANUP_THRESHOLD=86400
```

## Advanced Usage

### Preprocessing Profiles

The application includes several preset profiles for different document types:

- **Default**: Basic grayscale and sharpening, moderate contrast
- **Text-heavy Document**: Enhanced settings for documents with dense text
- **Scanned Document**: Optimized for typical scanned pages
- **Low Quality Image**: Aggressive enhancement for poor quality scans
- **Printed Text**: Optimized for machine-printed text
- **Handwriting**: Adjusted for handwritten content

### OCR Engines Comparison

- **Tesseract**: Fastest option with good accuracy for clear, printed text. Best for most documents.
- **EasyOCR**: Better with complex layouts and handwriting, but slower. Good for challenging documents where Tesseract struggles.
- **PyOCR**: Provides a unified interface to different OCR backends. Useful for testing different engines.

### Batch Processing

For batch processing multiple PDFs, consider using the Docker setup with a shared volume:

```bash
docker run -p 8011:8011 -v /path/to/your/pdfs:/app/batch ocr-pdf-docx
```

## Troubleshooting

### Dependency Issues

#### Tesseract Not Found
- Ensure Tesseract is installed correctly for your operating system.
- Verify that the Tesseract installation directory is in your system's PATH environment variable.
- On Windows, you may need to explicitly set the Tesseract path in `app.py`:
  ```python
  pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
  ```

#### Poppler / PDF Conversion Issues
- Ensure Poppler is installed and in your PATH.
- On Windows, check the installation directory and ensure it's properly added to the PATH.
- Restart your terminal/command prompt after making PATH changes.

#### OCR Engine-Specific Issues
- **EasyOCR**: Ensure PyTorch is installed correctly for your system (CPU or GPU version).
- **PyOCR**: Make sure Tesseract is installed as PyOCR relies on it.

### Common Errors

#### Empty or Incomplete OCR Results
- Try increasing the DPI settings to 600 DPI for better quality.
- Enable preprocessing options like sharpening and contrast adjustment.
- For low-quality scans, try using the "Low Quality Image" preset profile.
- Different OCR engines may produce better results for certain documents; try switching engines.

#### Performance Issues
- Processing large PDF files can be memory-intensive. Ensure your system has sufficient RAM.
- High-quality settings and certain preprocessing options significantly increase processing time.
- The first run with EasyOCR may be slow as it downloads language models.
